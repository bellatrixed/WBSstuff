        <h1 id="row1">My name is Eowyn, and I am an American living in Germany.</h1>
       <main id="main">
        <p class="textonleft row2">I moved here to pursue my career as an opera singer, but life happens, and I find myself at a crossroads.
        I've decided to stay in Germany because I met my partner and we are planning on getting married in the spring, or maybe next fall.
        We just got a kitten named Oberon, and he's the littlest fairy king.
        <br><br>I live in a town outside of Leipzig, which is known as the pearl of the Mulde valley.
        It's really beautiful here, and I love going cycling through the countryside. I read fantasy novels, and I've been doing a lot of graphic design lately:
          I'm considering opening my own etsy shop to sell Christmas cards and the like. </p>
        <div class="row2 placeholderright"> </div>
        <p class="textonright row3">Normally, I would punctuate this section with some really great photos, but codesandbox wouldn't allow me to upload images,
        and I got so fed up that I did all of this in pycharm, and copied it back over.<br>
        <br>I started coding around the time the pandemic started, because my boyfriend saw that I needed a new outlet,
        and as he is a programmer, he naturally thought it was the way to go. He started teaching me python:<br><br>
        I cried.
        <br><br>
        I've gotten better at python, though he and I still can't work on projects together, because he keeps throwing me into the deep end,
        when I'm still learning to swim. <br><br>(His code is really beautiful, and much better than I could write, though, so it's hard to complain while he's making my projects better)</p>

              <div class="row4 textonright titleright"> About Creativity</div>

       <p class="row5left">The reason my partner thought I would take to code, is that web design
      has been one of my side gigs for years. I was designing for other singers with WYSIWG editors,
      (all of which I have an opinion on), as well as programs, logos, posters and other illustrations.
         I love organizing information visually, and I love beautifully organized information.<br>
      <br>I started designing websites because, well, have you seen the average opera singer's website? It's awful.
   <br> I felt it was my duty to try and fix some of this, because it just.. was... not.. good. It made me so crazy.</p>
      <p class="row5right">
        But most importantly, I have a burning need to create. There is this energy that is always bursting to come out of me,
        be it in music, or visually when I design, or even through coding. I am driven to always be putting something new
        into the world. Coding has proven to be a wonderful outlet for that drive, as frustrating as it can sometimes be.<br>
         <br>I am enamoured with the magic that you can do with CSS, without even adding JavaScript (I will admit that I am a little intimidated by JavaScript)
        I love finding a beautiful solution to a mundane problem (ask me about my personal account program project).</p>
      <div class="row6">
          <h2 id="last">One last thing</h2>
          <p>I think that my creativity took a hit over the last week. The stress of the election got to me,
          I wasn't as able to focus on bringing my shiniest skills to the table here, or explain my creative process in a way I'm truly happy with.
          Which is why I am doing this now, on Sunday, instead of over several days, when I have the time and space to think about what needs to be done.
          <br> But mostly this section is because it brings symmetry to the page, and I like the way it looks.
